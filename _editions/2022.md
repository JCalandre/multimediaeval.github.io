The MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation benchmark offers tasks that are related to multimedia retrieval, analysis, and exploration. Participation is open to interested 
researchers who register. MediaEval focuses specifically on the human and social aspects of multimedia, and on multimedia systems that serve users. MediaEval tasks 
offer the opportunity for researchers to tackle challenges that bring together multiple modalities (visual, text, music, sensor data).
