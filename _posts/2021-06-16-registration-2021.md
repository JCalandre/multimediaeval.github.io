The Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (MediaEval) offers challenges related to multimedia analysis, retrieval and exploration. MediaEval tasks involve multiple modalities, (e.g., audio, visual, textual, and/or contextual) and focus on the human and social aspects of multimedia. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

Registration for participation in MediaEval 2021 is now open. Please visit the [MediaEval 2021 webpage](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2021/) for more information and the link to the registration page.
