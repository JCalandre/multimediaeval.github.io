Workshop registration is now open for the 2021 edition of the MediaEval Multiedia Evaluation workshop. 
Registration link and more information is available on the [MediaEval 2021 webpage](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2021) Multimedia Evaluation Workshop is underway. 
The workshop runs from 14:00-18:30 CET on Monday 13 December through Wednesday 15 December 2020 and is fully online. 

The goal of the workshop is to gain insight into MediaEval tasks and how they can be solved. 
Teams will be talking about how they addressed the tasks, but also about why they chose the solution that they did and about what they learned. 
We are looking forward to a dynamic and productive workshop.
